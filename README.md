# Code Complexity Analyzer

A responsive web application that analyzes source code files for complexity metrics. Users can upload or paste code in multiple programming languages and receive detailed breakdowns of cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, modularity score, and line statistics.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Analyze code in Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, C, Go, Lua, PHP, Ruby, Java, Swift, and Kotlin
- **Comprehensive Metrics**:
  - Cyclomatic Complexity: Measures the number of linearly independent paths through the code
  - Nesting Depth: Calculates the maximum depth of nested structures
  - Modularity Score: Assesses code organization based on function/method definitions
  - Line Statistics: Provides breakdown of total lines, code lines, comments, and empty lines
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Paste code directly or upload source files
- **Output Formats**: View results in human-readable format or JSON
- **Export Options**: Download analysis reports as Markdown or CSV files
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Sleek, professional interface with smooth animations and gradients

## Supported Languages

- Python (.py)
- JavaScript (.js)
- C++ (.cpp, .hpp)
- C# (.cs)
- C (.c, .h)
- Go (.go)
- Lua (.lua)
- PHP (.php)
- Ruby (.rb)
- Java (.java)
- Swift (.swift)
- Kotlin (.kt)

## How to Use

1. Select your programming language from the dropdown menu
2. Either paste your code directly into the text area or upload a source file
3. Click "Analyze Code" to generate complexity metrics
4. View results in human-readable format or switch to JSON view
5. Export your analysis as Markdown or CSV if needed

## Metrics Explained

### Cyclomatic Complexity
A quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Higher values indicate more complex code that may be harder to test and maintain.

### Nesting Depth
The maximum level of nesting in the code structure. Deep nesting can make code harder to read and understand.

### Modularity Score
A percentage indicating how well the code is broken down into functions/methods. Higher scores suggest better code organization.

### Line Statistics
- **Total Lines**: All lines in the file
- **Code Lines**: Lines containing actual code
- **Comment Lines**: Lines with comments
- **Empty Lines**: Blank lines

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the analyzer. No additional setup or dependencies required.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern web browsers that support ES6+ JavaScript features.
